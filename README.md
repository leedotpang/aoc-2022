# Advent of Code 2022

I'm super excited to try my hand at [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) for the first time. I'm not planning on handling it competitively (it includes a leaderboard to reward how quickly you solve the problems), but rather as a fun way to challenge myself both with problem-solving, as well as with a newer language to me (Go).

The last modification mentioned above was influenced by a friend of mine who decided it would be a good idea to try this same exercise...but with rust. I think my solution seems pretty sane, all things considered. That said, I imagine I won't be digging too much in the real-world minutia of Go, since the problems can usually be solved using imperative patterns.
